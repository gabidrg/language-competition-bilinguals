Description: Implementation of Minett-Wang language competition model in RePast Symphony 2.0

Model abstract:
"The mathematical model for language competition developed by Abrams and Strogatz allows the evolution 
of the numbers of monolingual speakers of two competing languages to be estimated. In this paper, we extend 
the model to examine the role of bilingualism and social structure, neither of which are addressed 
in the previous model. We consider the impact of two strategies for language maintenance: 
(1) adjusting the status of the endangered language; and (2) adjusting the availability of monolingual 
and bilingual educational resources. The model allows us to predict for which scenarios of intervention 
language maintenance is more likely to be achieved. Qualitative analysis of the model indicates a set of 
intervention strategies by which the likelihood of successful maintenance is expected to increase."
(Minett and Wang 2008)


Implementation notes:
This model respects the micro specifications of the Minett-Wang model as designed by the authors. 
Additionally, it provides two algorithms for computing language transition probabilities based on: 
(1) Moore neighborhood; 
(2) Complete graph.
